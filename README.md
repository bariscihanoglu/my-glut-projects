<h1 align='center'>My FreeGlut Projects</h1>

# What is this repo about?
  These are my projects that I made for my CTIS 164 Technical Mathematics with Programming course. <br>
  You have to install FreeGlut in order to run my programs. <br>
  All of the code is written in C language even though the file extensions are ".cpp".

### Project 1:
  If use arrow keys, you can change the position of the plane. <br>
  Pressing w makes plane faster and pressing s makes it slower. <br>
  Pressing n changes background to night or day. <br><br>

### Project 2:
  You shoot the balloons by pressing space button while changing gun's position with arrow keys. <br>
  Balloons spawn randomly at the right half. <br>
  Balloon colors are random. There are 5 balloons and they change colors upon respawning. <br>
  There is a max score. If player gets a higher then the max score, program shows "New high score" and changes the max score. <br>
  Background color changes according to the score.<br><br>

### Project 3 - Shoot The Ufo!:
  The enemy ufo follows a path that is found by using a 3rd degree function. <br>
  Our bullet changes form and position according to the enemy. <br>
  Birds will spawn randomly every time you open the game. <br>
  There is a scoreboard where you can see how many times you shot the ufo. <br><br>
