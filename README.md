<h1 align='center'>My FreeGlut Projects</h1>

# What is this repo about?
  These are my projects that I made for my CTIS 164 Technical Mathematics with Programming course. <br>
  You have to install FreeGlut in order to run my programs. <br>
  All of the code is written in C language even though the file extensions are ".cpp".
